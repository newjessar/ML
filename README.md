# ML-RUG

This project provides a comprehensive introduction to machine learning, exploring both unsupervised and supervised learning paradigms. In the realm of unsupervised learning, we delve into key techniques like dimensionality reduction, clustering, and density-based estimation methods, equipping learners with the tools to uncover hidden patterns in unlabelled data.

Moving to supervised learning, our focus shifts to solving classification problems. We particularly emphasize distance-based methods, showcasing Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ) as a prime example. This not only aids in understanding the nuances of classification but also bridges the gap to real-world applications.

A crucial aspect of our course is the exploration of validation techniques, providing insights into avoiding the pitfalls of over-fitting, a common challenge in both classification and regression contexts.

Throughout the course, we reinforce theoretical concepts with practical applications, ensuring a well-rounded understanding of machine learning's transformative power.
